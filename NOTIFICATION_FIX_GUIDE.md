# üîî FCM Notification Fix Guide

## Problem Identified
The backend was successfully sending FCM notifications, but the app wasn't receiving or displaying them because:
1. ‚ùå Missing `NotificationService.kt` (Android native service)
2. ‚ùå No Firebase Messaging listeners for foreground notifications
3. ‚ùå No background message handler setup
4. ‚ùå Missing notification channel configuration

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Android Notification Service
**File:** `android/app/src/main/java/com/wave/ai/waveapp/NotificationService.kt`
- Handles incoming FCM messages on Android
- Displays notifications when app is in background or closed
- Creates notification channels for Android 8+
- Plays notification sounds and handles taps

### 2. Updated Notification Service Functions
**File:** `services/notifications.ts`
- Added `setupFCMListeners()` - Handles foreground notifications
- Added `setupBackgroundMessageHandler()` - Handles background notifications
- Listens for notification taps (background & quit state)
- Handles token refresh events

### 3. Created Background Message Handler
**File:** `index.js` (new entry point)
- Registers background message handler at app startup
- Required for FCM to work properly

### 4. Updated App Entry Point
**File:** `package.json`
- Changed main entry from `expo-router/entry` to `index.js`
- Ensures background handler is registered before app starts

### 5. Updated App Layout
**File:** `app/_layout.tsx`
- Initializes FCM listeners on app start
- Properly cleans up listeners on unmount

### 6. Added Notification Channel
**File:** `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`
- Added `default_notification_channel_id` string resource

## üöÄ How to Test

### Step 1: Rebuild the App
Since we modified native Android files, you MUST rebuild:

```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..

# Rebuild the app
npx expo run:android
```

### Step 2: Verify Setup
1. Open the app
2. Navigate to the chat section
3. Enable notifications when prompted
4. Check console logs for:
   - ‚úÖ `Native FCM Token obtained:`
   - ‚úÖ `Native FCM Token registered:`

### Step 3: Test Notifications

#### Test While App is Open (Foreground)
1. Keep the app open
2. Send a test notification from your backend
3. **Expected:** Notification appears as a banner at the top

#### Test While App is in Background
1. Press home button (don't close app)
2. Send a test notification
3. **Expected:** Notification appears in notification tray
4. **Tap notification:** App opens

#### Test While App is Closed
1. Swipe away the app from recent apps
2. Send a test notification
3. **Expected:** Notification appears in notification tray
4. **Tap notification:** App launches

## üì± Console Logs to Watch For

### Successful Setup:
```
[notifications] Native FCM Token obtained: fpFxUxKkT1W...
Native FCM Token registered: {...}
```

### Foreground Notification:
```
üîî FCM message received in foreground: {...}
```

### Background Notification:
```
üîî FCM message received in background: {...}
```

### Notification Tap:
```
üîî Notification opened app from background: {...}
```

## üéØ Key Changes Summary

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Foreground Notifications | ‚ùå Not handled | ‚úÖ Shows banner |
| Background Notifications | ‚ùå Not displayed | ‚úÖ Shows in tray |
| App Closed Notifications | ‚ùå Not working | ‚úÖ Shows in tray |
| Notification Taps | ‚ùå No handler | ‚úÖ Opens app |
| Token Registration | ‚úÖ Working | ‚úÖ Working |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If notifications still don't work:

1. **Check App Permissions**
   - Go to Android Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Wave.ai ‚Üí Notifications
   - Ensure "All Wave.ai notifications" is ON

2. **Verify FCM Token**
   - Check console for token: `fpFxUxKkT1W...`
   - Confirm it matches the token in your backend

3. **Check Android Logs**
   ```bash
   npx react-native log-android
   ```
   Look for:
   - `WaveNotificationService`
   - `FCM message received`

4. **Rebuild Clean**
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   ./gradlew assembleDebug --info
   cd ..
   npx expo run:android
   ```

5. **Test with Firebase Console**
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
   - Send a test message to your device token
   - This bypasses your backend to test FCM directly

## üìù Backend Testing

Your backend response shows success:
```json
{
  "message": "FCM notification sent to 1/1 tokens",
  "success": true
}
```

This is perfect! The issue was purely on the app side.

## üéâ Next Steps

After rebuilding:
1. ‚úÖ Notifications will display in all app states
2. ‚úÖ Users can tap notifications to open the app
3. ‚úÖ Sounds and vibrations will work
4. ‚úÖ Notification channel allows user control

## üí° Additional Features You Can Add

1. **Custom Notification Icons**
   - Create `drawable/notification_icon.png`
   - Update `NotificationService.kt` to use it

2. **Deep Linking**
   - Add navigation logic in notification tap handlers
   - Example: Open specific chat when notification is tapped

3. **Notification Actions**
   - Add "Reply" or "Mark as Read" buttons
   - Handle actions in `NotificationService.kt`

4. **Notification Grouping**
   - Group multiple notifications together
   - Show summary notification

**Remember:** Always rebuild after modifying native Android files!
